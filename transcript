North Carolina leading by 1. 
Yale and their team captain, Scott Sterling.
Love that man.
Don't we all?
Trying desperately to hold them here, or it's all over.
Match point for the Tar Heels, Jones preparing for what may be the last serve of his college career.

And here we go.

Excellent serve!

Thompson setting up, here comes the spike!

Yale has to stop this return or el... OH DEFLECTED! Right into Scott's Sterling face and
Yale ties it up! Unbelievable!

Buckle up ladies and gentlemen because Scott Sterling's face has entered the building.

Take a gander at this replay.
The angle at which Sterling deflects the ball off his skull, is nothing short of perfection.
Like watching Da Vinci paint with his face.

The crowd is now on their feet.

Like mythical Atlas who bore the weight of the world upon his back,
so too as Scott Sterling bore this team upon his face.

Yale has come back from the brink,
and is looking to put this one into the history books.
